### Week 1

Overview: This week I conducted research regarding my project. I took time to conduct research on where to begin with my backend project. I research more about using Firebase, and Google Book API. Using the combination of the Google Book API and Firebase I am able to utilize a Google login, and simply store a token to verify the user on login. Using these two systems together I can better utilize Google Book API to leverage their BookShelf functionality and display books a user may already have stored on their google account. Firebase was simple to implement on the backend of my application as well. I just need a route to manage the token that will be stored when a user logs in with their Google account and then fetch that token for authorization.
<br>
üåµ Challenges: My main challenge this week was deciding where to start. My application will mostly rely on the frontend as that is where the Google Books api will be used and integrated. Starting with my back-end made it a bit easier as it is a bit more basic. With only one route and needing to connect firebase. I am still struggling to decide where to start with the front-end of my application as well as I need to figure out how to link my front-end to my back-end when it is ready. I have not linked a front-end with firebase to a backend with firebase before.
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments: This week I did a lot of research pertaining to my project. I feel accomplished I was able to complete a decent amount of research pertaining to Google Books API and firebase as well as complete the simple back-end for my project. More work may need to be done to the backend when it is time to connect the front-end to the backend.
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps: My next step is to do a bit more research pertaining to where to start with my front-end. I believe I will start with my login screen and complete the login set-up using Google with Firebase. I will need to do more research pertaining to how the token will work with authorization and authentication. Once I have these steps done I will start work to fetch data from the Google Books API. This will happen at the same time as my dashboard page being created. My goal for week two is to complete the login set-up and the dashboard page with fetching data from the Google Books API.

### Week 2

Overview: This week I worked on completing my login route through Firebase Google Login. I completed the design for the login page and navbar. I began work on completing the design of the Dashboard. I was able to deploy my backend to Firebase cloud functions and run my localhost and my deployed front end off of the same functions. I created the user database to store user information and completed work on creating and authenticating the user token UID with Firebase. While completing this development I research Google Analytics and how to use it. I am great ful as Firebase automatically sets up Google Analytics at no cost with any project created with it. This offers many features such as event tracking for over 500 different events, live user statistics, active user counts etc. While using Firebase they also offer a stability tracker of my application. This will help provide feedback on errors, or problems occurring within my application once deployed.
<br>
üåµ Challenges this week include: setting up the login functionality and and retrieving the token being generated by Firebase when a user would login. I also was having issues with CORS as it would not allow the popup window needed for the user to sign in. During the end of the week, I am unsure as to why it happened but I merged a branch into my dev branch to get it ready for staging and it broke several branches on my repo. This would not let me commit, pull, or change any of the branches. I had to rebase the dev branch and created a dev2 branch which I will be using moving forward. I was able to save all of my files but I was stuck for a bit on fixing the issue.
<br>
üèÜ My greatest accomplishment this week was connecting my login route. I had many issues with it working properly. First of course was cors issues which was due to vite-config file, and I did not import cors properly. This was also giving me trouble as Firebase was wanting to point to a deployed version of my backend code while it wasn't deployed so it would not allow me to retrieve the token UID saved in the database. Through the use of the documentation and the AI built into firebase I was able to successfully connect this route and deploy the backend code of my project which fixed these issues I was having.
<br>
üîÆ My next step is to build out the Dashboard page and fully connect the Google Books API. I will fetch all data I need including genres, author, book titles, and individual books. I will be researching this week about how to access a users bookshelf on their google books account so I can fetch the data from that and display it to the bookshelf on my application. I will also be researching on how and if I can add books to the bookshelf on my application while also adding them to a users bookshelf. After completing this step I will continue to build out the remainder of the pages of my application. This includes the profile page, and the bookshelf.

### Week 3

Overview: This week was a good bit of design work. Following my figma design and using tailwind it was easy to incorporate designs for each page. Fetching the Google books api went very smoothly except for the limit they place on the amount of calls I am able to make per day. The first day of setting up the Google books api fetch calls, I implemented 10 genres with 20 books per genre. This quickly caused me to hit my limit from fetching the books on the Dashboard page and through the search. Originally the search feature was implemented to fetch the books as the user was typing in the name to display the books in a drop down list however, this caused a massive spike in api calls as well. I since removed this and only make one call per search. I was able to implement the book information page and the profile page this week as well. Both of these pages have a very basic design and setup. I had to create a collection to hold the user profile information, this was simple as it was very similar to how I implemented the login save route. To finish the week I am researching innovation and security.
<br>
üåµ Challenges this week include: Combating api fetch limit was my main challenge this week. I research quite a bit on how to implement restricting the number of calls I was making to the Google Books API. Originally I started with 10 genres and 20 books per genre. This quickly became an issue as each genre was running as a separate API call. The second feature I started with was fetching books as a user was typing. Again this became taxing quite quickly and I hit my limit very quickly. Through some research though I found you can Cache Api calls to limit the amount of times a call is made. I also limited the number of genres I initially had to 5, and I removed the feature to populate books in a drop down menu for now to limit the amount of calls I was making to the API.
<br>
üèÜ My greatest accomplishment this week was completing most of my additional pages. I completed my Dashboard, Book Information, and Profile pages. These pages didn't require as much technical code, and relied mainly on the fetch request, and design. While my book information page needs a bit more work to function properly I am confident I will complete my project. The functionality required to finish my Book Information screen is to add the book to the users Bookshelf. As of now my plan is to incorporate Google Books Bookshelf into my application. Once this is complete I will need to fetch the users Bookshelf from Google Books, and design the Bookshelf page.
<br>
üîÆ My next step as described in the accomplishment, is to finish the final two pages of my application. My book information screen will need to be able to add books to a users Google Book Shelf, and I will need to them fetch that data and display it on the Bookshelf page within my application. I will need to finish conducting my research on how to fully implement this as it is my final step and may be a bit of a challenge.

### Week 4

Overview: This week I took the time to design and develop my the final page of my application. While I took the time to solve the issues I was having with multiple different merge conflicts, I created a new Git repository for my application. This ensures I am able to deploy when changes are committed to the main branch. This week I also took the time to clean some of my code up and ha a friend test my application and give me some feedback. While most of my time was spent creating my final page, I was able to get my application ready for beta release. More work will need to be done to finish cleaning up various spots of code, and set up final deployment plans for my website.
<br>
üåµ Challenges this week include: setting up and using the different collections offered by the Google Books API. There are several different Api calls that I had to make to display the information correctly, I was unable to get two of the collections working properly. These collections include: Recently Viewed, and Reviewed. I plan to implement these collections in the future. Setting up authorization within my application was not as difficult as I believed it would be, however my application is not fully linked with Google so it displays a warning message to the user when they log in. This warning message is due to fetching the googleBooksToken when the user logs in and storing it for use when the user accesses the bookshelf page to view their collections.
<br>
üèÜ My greatest accomplishment this week was completing the bookshelf page, as well as cleaning up some of my code. While the bookshelf page is not one hundred percent done I was able to complete the request for several different collections from the Google Books API, and display the books to the user.
<br>
üîÆ My next step is to finish development of the bookshelf page, and continue to tweak the styling of my various pages. I will work to finish setting up automatic deployments when the main branch gets merged into. I will also be developing a plan to build this into a mobile application I will be able to deploy for use. This will require a bit of research on how to properly deploy an application, integrate better security and authorization flow, connecting my application with google entirely as to not display warnings when users sign in, and build out better and more robust features for the users while on my application. Such features could include: better discovery options, clean UI, more collections, internal and external review support, and much more.
